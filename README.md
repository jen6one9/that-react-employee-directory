# that-react-employee-directory
Employee directory app created with React web framework.  When the user loads the page, the app renders a table of employees.  The user has the ability to sort the table by category and features a search box that allows the user to filter by property. 

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
